\title{Cut numeric vector into factor vector}
\usage{
cut(x, at, label = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector to be cut into factors.}

\item{at}{A numeric vector specifying the breakpoints or categories
for cutting the vector. If a single value is provided,
the function will create breaks using the same method as \verb{[base::cut]}.
If multiple values are provided, they are treated as specific breaks.}

\item{label}{Optional labels for the resulting factor levels.
If not provided, labels will be automatically generated based on the breaks.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \verb{[base::cut]}
if \code{x} is not numeric.}
}
\value{
A factor representing the cut vector
with factor levels assigned based on the breaks or categories.
}
\description{

}
\details{
This function cuts a numeric vector into factors
based on specified breaks or categories.
If the input vector is not numeric, the function delegates
to the base R \code{cut} function.
}
\examples{
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
cut(x, 2)
}
